Here are some tasks I have done through this assessment:
1. I have restructured the project a little bit. I added two `.net core class libraries` called `Assessment.Business` and `Assessment.Tests`. The former contains `Assessment.cs` file, in which you can find the implementation of the methods I was supposed to complete.
2. The `Assessment.Tests` includes almost ***26 unit tests*** which cover different scenarios and inputs. All the tests are implemented by ***XUnit***. For mocking the interfaces I have used ***Moq nuget package***. You can find them in `Assessment_Test.cs` file.
3. As it has not been mentioned that I have to use git, I did not add this project to a git repo. Please let me know if it is mandatory.
4. Although there are always better ways to develop codes, I tried to use a wide variety of concepts such as recursive methods, linq to object queries, and different data structures in the right situations.

And finally, thank you for your time and consideration :)
